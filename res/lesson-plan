clone the repo using
git clone https://github.com/joeb15/learning-git.git

create a branch of your own
git branch {cp-login}

for example
git branch jvbanko

check that new branch out
git checkout {cp-login}

create a basic text file that has your full name in it

for example
/res/jvbanko contains the text "people.Joe Banko"

add the file to be tracked
git add /res/{cp-login}

commit the file to git with a message
git commit -m "This is my name!"

push the file to the git repo
git push -u origin {cp-login}

now, for the fun part...
we will be doing some work on the same branch... kindof

we will create a copy of the main branch
to do this, we will go to the main branch
git checkout main

then we will copy the main branch
git branch -C main-{cp-login}

on this branch, we will create the change that we want:
edit your class and modify the method to do the right thing.

add, then commit this and push to your new branch
git add
git commit -m
git push -u origin main-{cp-login}

now, head to the github page and create a pull request:
https://github.com/joeb15/learning-git

click on the tab that says pull requests

click new pull request

set the base to main, and the comparison branch to main-{cp-login}

click create pull request, and then write a basic description of what you changed
