clone the repo using
git clone https://github.com/joeb15/learning-git.git

create a branch of your own
git branch {cp-login}

for example
git branch jvbanko

check that new branch out
git checkout {cp-login}

create a basic text file that has your full name in it

for example
/res/jvbanko contains the text "Joe Banko"

add the file to be tracked
git add /res/{cp-login}

commit the file to git with a message
git commit -m "This is my name!"

Now, add another line to this file that has a basic Bio about you:
Maybe "I am a backend dev for the team"

now add and commit this file
git add, git commit -m

Now, before we push to the repo, we want to squash our changes, meaning combine the two commits into one
we can do this by interactively rebasing the commits.
git rebase -i

Then, we will change pick to squash for the second commit
Then, save the file. This will bring up another editor that you can change the commit message
Change the commit message to something like "My name and bio"

Now push the file to the git repo
git push -u origin {cp-login}

now, for the fun part...
we will be doing some work on the same branch... kindof

we will create a copy of the main branch
to do this, we will go to the main branch
git checkout main

then we will copy the main branch
git branch -C main-{cp-login}

on this branch, we will create the change that we want:
edit your class and modify the method to do the right thing.

add, then commit this and push to your new branch
git add
git commit -m
git push -u origin main-{cp-login}

now, head to the github page and create a pull request:
https://github.com/joeb15/learning-git

click on the tab that says pull requests

click new pull request

set the base to main, and the comparison branch to main-{cp-login}

click create pull request, and then write a basic description of what you changed
make this of the style of our PR templates, this is what Jill and Joe will read before looking at your code.

under the reviewers tab, add Jill and Joe: jipo-calpoly & joeb15

assign Joe, Jill and yourself as Assignees

add the proper labels to the PR (enhancement and maybe documentation if you added it)

Make sure you get the proper approvals before merging your PR into the codebase
